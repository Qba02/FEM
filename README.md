## Description
This project was developed as a final assignment for the FEM course at AGH.
Finite element method (FEM) software presented in this project is able to simulate the unsteady heat transfer process with a convection boundary condition for 2D meshes.

## Overview
- **[include](./include/)** - this folder contains all header files (.h) with declarations of classes and functions
- **[src](./src/)** - source files (implementation of those classes and functions)
- **[input_files](./input_files/)** - input files that contains grid diagram (Example)
- **[output_files](./output_files/)** - output files for each simulation moment (Example)
- **[result-images](./results-images/)** - a set of sample images showing simulation results for input data (Example)
- **[main.cpp](./main.cpp)** - main program file
- **[Sprawozdanie.pdf](./Sprawozdanie_MES.pdf)** - detailed description of the software and MES method (in Polish)
